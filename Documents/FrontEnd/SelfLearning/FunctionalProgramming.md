What is a Function?
A function is a process which takes some input, called arguments, and produces some output called a return value. Functions may serve the following purposes:
Mapping: Produce some output based on given inputs. A function maps input values to output values.
Procedures: A function may be called to perform a sequence of steps. The sequence is known as a procedure, and programming in this style is known as procedural programming.
I/O: Some functions exist to communicate with other parts of the system, such as the screen, storage, system logs, or network.
